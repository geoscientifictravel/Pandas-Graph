# Pandas-Graph
Here is a way to sample certain data from a CSV array with output to a graph divided by months.


The source file consisted of 18 columns, with about 40,000 lines of different names (items) of orders. 
First, the speakers were cleaned. Then the union by values (months). With the help of the PANDAS tool, 
a sample was made and the necessary graph was built using the seaborn module. This example shows how you 
can make a convenient graph for analytics.
