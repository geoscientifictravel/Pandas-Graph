# Pandas-Graph
Here is a way to sample certain data from a CSV array with output to a graph divided by months.

#The source file consisted of 18 columns, with about 40,000 lines of different names (items) of orders. 
#First, the speakers were cleaned. Then the union by values (months). With the help of the PANDAS tool, 
#a sample was made and the necessary graph was built using the seaborn module. This example shows how you 
#can make a convenient graph for analytics.
